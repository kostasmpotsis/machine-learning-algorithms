# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

This project aims to build a predictive model to classify whether a hotel booking will be canceled or not. The data consists of a random sample of room bookings from a hotel, including various features related to each booking and its cancellation status.
The dataset includes information on room bookings with the following features:

Booking ID: Unique identifier for each booking.
Check-in Date: The date on which the booking is supposed to start.
Check-out Date: The date on which the booking is supposed to end.
Room Type: The type of room booked.
Number of Guests: The number of guests included in the booking.
Booking Date: The date on which the booking was made.
Booking Source: The platform or method used to make the booking.
Booking Status: Indicates whether the booking was canceled or not.
